# What-is-hysteroscopy-and-when-do-doctors-recommend-it-during-infertility-workup-

Hysteroscopy is a simple procedure where the doctor uses a tiny camera (scope) to look inside your uterus. It helps to find problems like polyps, fibroids, adhesions (scar tissue), or abnormal shape of uterus that may stop you from getting pregnant.

Doctors recommend it if youâ€™ve had repeated IVF failures, unusual bleeding, or miscarriage. Sometimes an ultrasound shows something odd, and hysteroscopy gives a clear view. Itâ€™s a same-day, minor surgeryâ€”no stitches, quick recovery.

At Trinity IVF, doctors use it both for checking (diagnostic hysteroscopy) and fixing (operative hysteroscopy) problems inside the uterus. The benefit is hugeâ€”it increases chances of embryo implantation and pregnancy after IVF.

Some people feel scared about the word "surgery," but itâ€™s not painful. Itâ€™s like a high-tech scan with treatment option included. And the best part? You can go home same day.
